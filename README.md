# Schedule Your Day

## Description
---
A simple calendar application, which allows users to save events for each hour of the day. It is perfect for scheduling your work day, or any type of scheduling needs. I wanted to create something that would help keep my day organized and to keep me on schedule, during my days. It is simple to use and you can save your event, in-case you need to exit or it closes by accident. Just come back to it.

    Some of the concepts I learned: 
    * how to use this
    * how to getItem and setItem with jquery

    I further understood:
    * jquery
    * getting items with jquery
    * retrieving local and global variables

The date changes each day, matching the current date. A clear button to clear the pages stored data and text area. The hours are from 5AM to 6PM, since some people's work day start earlier than others. On the right is the save button, with a save icon. Click to save the event. The textarea color changes depening on the day. Grey for past, peach-red for present and green for the future.
